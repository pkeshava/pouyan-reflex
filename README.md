# Landing page and porfolio project using reflex

Developing my personal webpage using reflex. Started this project with the [react-three-next starter](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-next) ... going to try and port that [repository's](https://github.com/pkeshava/nextjs-rf3-portfolio) code so that I just work in python... with exception to the react components (3D assets) which I will try and wrap using React.
